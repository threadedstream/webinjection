# webinjection

DVWA clone that's got a whole slew of vulnerabilities. 
I plan to represent it as a collection of levels 

## TODO 
- Add docker-compose.yml 
- Make index page look more beautiful and descriptive
- Add XSS level 
- Write frontend separately? 


## How to run 
Run the following commands
```
  docker-compose build 
  docker-compose up 
```
