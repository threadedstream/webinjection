# webinjection

DVWA clone that's got a whole slew of vulnerabilities. 
I plan to represent it as a collection of levels 

## TODO 
1. Add docker-compose.yml 
1. Make index page look more beautiful and descriptive
1. Add XSS level 
1. Write frontend separately? 


## How to run 
Run the following commands
```
  docker-compose build 
  docker-compose up 
```
